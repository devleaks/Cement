Cement jAlbum Skin
==================

 

Cement is a minimal jAlbum skin that uses

-   [jAlbum](<http://jAlbum.net/>), an online gallery creation tool to generate
    directory structure and resize images;

-   [Masonry](<http://masonry.desandro.com/>), a JavaScript grid layout library;

-   [fancybox](<http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/>), a tool for displaying images,
    html content and multi-media in a Mac-style "lightbox" that floats overtop
    of web page;

-   [Flowplayer](<http://flowplayer.org/>), an HTML5, JavaScript, video player.

-   [Color Thief](<http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/>), a JavaScript
    library to get the dominant color or a color palette from an image.

-   [Color Thief Java](<https://github.com/SvenWoltmann/color-thief-java/>), a
    Java class to get the dominant color or a color palette from an image.

-   [Infinite Scroll](<http://www.infinite-scroll.com/>), a JavaScript library
    to load pages on demand, as you scroll down.

There also are other pieces of codes stolen here and there like the [forkit
ribbon](<http://lab.hakim.se/forkit-js/>), or [pure CSS
ribbons](<http://unindented.org/articles/2009/10/github-ribbon-using-css-transforms/>).

The code of the skin is based on the skin called Minimal which is provided with
jAlbum. All credits goes to the jAlbum, Minimal Skin, flowplayer, Fancybox,
Masonry, Color Thief, and Infinite Scroll developers.

This project just puts the necessary glue between these pieces of software.
Hence its name.

Now go take picture.
